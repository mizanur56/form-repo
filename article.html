          An interview with renowned economic historian Michael Hudson on where
          our calendar comes from, his collaborations with the late intellectual
          David Graeber and the long-lost practice of forgiving debt.

            Hudson’s <a class="re" href="">research</a> has already made inroads
            into modern life. Many contemporary economists rely on his
            understanding of financial history in the Ancient Near East.
            Hudson’s collaboration with the late anthropologist and activist
            David Graeber inspired his launch of the debt cancellation movement
            during Occupy Wall Street.

            Graeber’s book Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a popularized adaption
            of Hudson’s research on the early financial systems of the Near
            East, encouraging Graeber to follow up and coauthor the bestselling
            book The Dawn of Everything, an overview of new interpretations in
            archaeology and anthropology about the many paths society can take.
